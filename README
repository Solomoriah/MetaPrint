MetaPrint.py defines a class and utility functions for use by programs 
which also use MSWinPrint.py for output.  MetaPrint exposes a document
class which replicates the functionality of MSWinPrint, but rather than
actually printing, a document object collects the output generated so
that it can be replayed, either via MSWinPrint or ImagePrint.  This is
useful mainly to preview a print job (by running the MetaPrint document
through ImagePrint) and subsequently actually print it (via MSWinPrint).

document is a class for creating and running print jobs.  Presently, the 
source is the only documentation for this class.
